1. initial mostly backand and dummy frontend
  - one folder - single test run
  - all json files there - suites
  - each suite has some structure - suite has tests, tests have steps, steps could have their steps
  - on get /suites                           returns suites id's
  - on get /suites/:id                       returns suite data
  - on get /suites/:id/tests                 returns test id's
  - on get /suites/:id/tests/:id             returns test data
  - on get /suites/:id/tests/:id/steps       returns step id's
  - on get /suites/:id/tests/:id/steps/:id   returns step id's
